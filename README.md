# NETFLIX_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS_CLUSTERING

Introduction :
dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

OBJECTIVE :-
Understanding what type content is available in different countries

Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

Clustering similar content by matching text-based features

Data Pipeline:
● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this part we have done some EDA on the features to see the trend.

● Data Processing: In this part we went through each attributes and encoded the categorical features.

● Model Creation: Finally in this part we created the various models. These various models are being analysed and we tried to study various models so as to get the best performing model for our project

Model’s Performed :-
Hypothesis testing

Feature selection

Machine learning algorithms(unsupervised)

Problem Statement
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings
